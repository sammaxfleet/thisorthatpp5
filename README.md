# THIS OR THAT 


'This Or That' is an online website that compares celbrity fashion outfits. It allows users to create user profiles & compare likes. 
The user gets to prefer which outfit a celbrity is wearing. 
It's a battle of style, which one is your taste?... Which then gives the users space to comment their opinion and connect with the 'This Or That' Community. 



This project was built as the final portfolio submission for the @codeinstitute higher national diploma full stack software development.
The project has been split into 2 parts- the front end built with react and the back end API powered by Django rest frame work.

More info on the back end readme can be found here -

This can bring a lot of inspiration into the space. 
Users could be male or female, there is an equal spread of fashion content on there. 

## PROJECT MANAGEMENT - 

An agile methodology was used to plan and develop the This or That project.
All the main features of the application were recorded as epics and then refined into user stories.
These user stories were created and stored as GitHub issues and then mapped into iterations to help to plan the project and allocate the workload.

# THIS OR THAT 


'This Or That' is an online website that compares celbrity fashion outfits. It allows users to create user profiles & compare likes. 
The user gets to prefer which outfit a celbrity is wearing. 
It's a battle of style, which one is your taste?... Which then gives the users space to comment their opinion and connect with the 'This Or That' Community. 



This project was built as the final portfolio submission for the @codeinstitute higher national diploma full stack software development.
The project has been split into 2 parts- the front end built with react and the back end API powered by Django rest frame work.

More info on the back end readme can be found here -

This can bring a lot of inspiration into the space. 
Users could be male or female, there is an equal spread of fashion content on there. 

## PROJECT MANAGEMENT - 

An agile methodology was used to plan and develop the This or That project.
All the main features of the application were recorded as epics and then refined into user stories.
These user stories were created and stored as GitHub issues and then mapped into iterations to help to plan the project and allocate the workload.

# Sit Structure - 

ThisorThat is split up in two parts: Either when the user is logged out or when the user is logged in.
Depending on login status different page states are available for the user.
When the user is logged out the pages: Home, and Sign In or Up are available from the Navigation Bar menu. When the user is logged in Commentss, Signout and Profile Page also become available.


Colour Scheme - 
I took inspiration from fashion blogs, and stores like Zara & Arte. Which are sleek, simple & focus on the photo. 
Where this is a white background as full focus goes on the image, the user is then drawn to the content. Two contrasting colours are used to naviagte through the website.

The Navigation Bar is very clean and straight forward. Depending on wether you're signed in or not a different option on the menu appears.
On accessing the site for the first time, the user is logged out and the following menu items are visible:


Authentication - 

Users who are new to the site, or haven't previously created an account can click on the Signup Menu option on the Navigation Bar to create a user account. I have used the standard dj-rest/auth/registration user account signup process for this.
